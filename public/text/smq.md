Small Group Questions – Matthew 1:18-25 – The Virgin Birth
1) Discuss – Do you find people in Canada today objecting more to the miracles in the
Bible1 or the morality2 of the Bible? Why? Which do you personally find harder to
accept?

2) Dig – In Matthew 1:22-23, we’re told that “all this [including the virgin birth] took
place to fulfill3 what the Lord had spoken by the prophet.” This is the first of six
fulfillment narratives in the first four chapters of Matthew.
The others appear in:
- Matthew 2:1-6
- Matthew 2:13-15
- Matthew 2:16-18
- Matthew 3:1-3
- Matthew 4:12-17

Read through them together as a group. What stands out about these fulfillment
narratives? And how do they testify to the faithfulness of God?

3) Do – If God can fulfill his promises through miracles like the virgin birth, he can meet
your expectations for him in your life. Share with your group ways that you struggle
to trust God’s Word, his promises, or his moral principles. How might the testimony
of his fulfilled Word help you to practically trust him moving forward?

Guided Prayer Points
After sharing prayer requests with your group, pray through them along with the following –
1) Praise God for fulfilling his promises and plans in Jesus Christ.
2) Confess to God your own doubts and struggles to trust him.
3) Thank God for his faithfulness displayed in Jesus and his first coming.
4) Ask God to help you trust him until Jesus comes a second time.

*1 Miracles such as the virgin birth, the ascension, turning water into wine, the bodily resurrection

etc.
3 “Fulfill” is a verb that means ‘to do what you said you would do, to achieve something, or to meet a requirement.’
Webster defines fulfil as “to put something into effect, to meet the requirements of a promise or business
agreement, to measure up to expectations, to bring a plan to its appointed end, to develop the full potentialities of
one’s potential, to convert expectations or promises into reality.”*
